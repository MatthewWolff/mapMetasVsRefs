This pipeline calculates the coverage and ANI for each metagenome included to each reference Genome

Directory Structure:
| - metagenomes : directory to place (or link) all the metagenomes to include in analysis
| - refGenomes : directory to place (or link) all the reference genomes to include in analysis
| - scripts : directory that contains scripts for analysis
